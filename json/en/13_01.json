Hill (1812–1879) was a British born American artist working in watercolor, gouache, lithography, and engraving. Hill's work focussed primarily upon natural subjects including landscapes, still lifes, and ornithological and zoological subjects. In the 1850s, influenced by John Ruskin and Hill's association with American followers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, his attention turned from technical illustration toward still life and landscape. <br><br><a href='http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_William_Hill' target='_blank'>Read more...<\/a><br><a href='http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/John_William_Hill' target='_blank'>Take a look at DBpedia...<\/a><\/p>","asset":{"media":"img\/no_image_available.png","credit":"","caption":"John William Hill","thumbnail":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/4d\/HillThrasherAmRobin.jpg\/200px-HillThrasherAmRobin.jpg"}},{"startDate":"1848,01,13","dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Lilla_Cabot_Perry","headline":"Lilla Cabot Perry (Birth)","text":"<p style='text-align: justify;'>Lilla Cabot Perry (January 13, 1848—February 28, 1933) was an American artist who worked in the Impressionist style, rendering portraits and landscapes in the free form manner of her mentor, Claude Monet.
