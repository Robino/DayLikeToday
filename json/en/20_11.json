Kent was an artist and an educator who worked in Los Angeles and Boston. She worked almost exclusively with silkscreen and serigraphy, helping to establish it as a fine art medium. Her artwork, with its messages of love and peace, was particularly popular during the social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s. Kent designed the 1985 annual \"love\" stamp. <br><br><a href='http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Corita_Kent' target='_blank'>Read more...<\/a><br><a href='http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Corita_Kent' target='_blank'>Take a look at DBpedia...<\/a><\/p>","asset":{"media":"img\/no_image_available.png","credit":"","caption":"Corita Kent","thumbnail":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/80\/Sister_Corita_Kent.jpg\/200px-Sister_Corita_Kent.jpg"}},{"startDate":"1936,11,20","dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Luciano_Fabro","headline":"Luciano Fabro (Birth)","text":"<p style='text-align: justify;'>Luciano Fabro (November 20, 1936 - June 22, 2007) was an Italian artist associated with the Arte Povera movement. <br><br><a href='http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Luciano_Fabro' target='_blank'>Read more...<\/a><br><a href='http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Luciano_Fabro' target='_blank'>Take a look at DBpedia...<\/a><\/p>","asset":{"media":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0c\/KMM_Fabro_01.JPG","credit":"","caption":"Luciano Fabro","thumbnail":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/0c\/KMM_Fabro_01.JPG\/200px-KMM_Fabro_01.JPG"}},{"startDate":"1962,11,20","dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gail_Ann_Dorsey","headline":"Gail Ann Dorsey (Birth)","text":"<p style='text-align: justify;'>Gail Ann Dorsey (born November 20, 1962) is an American musician considered one of the premier bass guitarists and vocalists within the alternative rock scene.
