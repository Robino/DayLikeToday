Kelly (artist) (Death)","text":"<p style='text-align: justify;'>James Edward Kelly (July 30, 1855 – May 25, 1933) was an American sculptor and illustrator who specialized in depicting people and events of American wars, particularly the American Civil War. Kelly was born in New York City. He was a boy of six years old when the Civil War started. Perhaps because of that he early developed a lifelong interest in American history, particularly in the Civil War and in the generals who fought it. <br><br><a href='http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_E._Kelly_(artist)' target='_blank'>Read more...<\/a><br><a href='http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/James_E._Kelly_(artist)' target='_blank'>Take a look at DBpedia...<\/a><\/p>","asset":{"media":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ea\/Gettysburg_Council_of_War.jpg","credit":"","caption":"James E.
