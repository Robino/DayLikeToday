Royce Campbell was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. <br><br><a href='http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Royce_Campbell' target='_blank'>Read more...<\/a><br><a href='http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Royce_Campbell' target='_blank'>Take a look at DBpedia...<\/a><\/p>","asset":{"media":"img\/no_image_available.png","credit":"","caption":"Royce Campbell","thumbnail":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/70\/Royce_campbell.jpg\/200px-Royce_campbell.jpg"}},{"startDate":"1956,06,07","dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/L.A._Reid","headline":"L.A.
