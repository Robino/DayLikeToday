His parents owned a shoeshop called La Palma, which gave him his nickname (Niño de la Palma). In 1917 he first began to perform as a bullfighter in the ranches of the area were he lived. In 1923 he had his debut in Ronda, where he became the first bullfighter to be carried in triumph through the main gates of the Maestranza, and in 1924 he caused great commotion again when the same thing happened in Seville. <br><br><a href='http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cayetano_Ordóñez' target='_blank'>Read more...<\/a><br><a href='http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cayetano_Ord%C3%B3%C3%B1ez' target='_blank'>Take a look at DBpedia...<\/a><\/p>","asset":{"media":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/89\/CayetanoOrdoñez.JPG","credit":"","caption":"Cayetano Ordóñez","thumbnail":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/89\/CayetanoOrdoñez.JPG\/200px-CayetanoOrdoñez.JPG"}}]}}
