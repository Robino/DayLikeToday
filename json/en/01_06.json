The Roper steam velocipede of 1867–1869 may have been the first motorcycle, for which he was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2002. <br><br><a href='http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sylvester_H._Roper' target='_blank'>Read more...<\/a><br><a href='http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sylvester_H._Roper' target='_blank'>Take a look at DBpedia...<\/a><\/p>","asset":{"media":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/87\/Sylvester_H_Roper_Died_in_the_Saddle_Boston_Daily_Globe_2_June_1896.png","credit":"","caption":"Sylvester H.
